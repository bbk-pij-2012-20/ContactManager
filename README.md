<h1>Contact Manager</h1>

This is the 1st of 4 programming courseworks I completed (Dec 2013/Jan 2014) as part of a conversion masters in Computer Science at Birkbeck College London.

The coursework task was to implement interfaces describing a simple contact manager application. 

It was also intended that implementing the class ContactManager would serve as a demonstration of an anti-pattern ("the blob" aka "god object"), wherein too much functionality is placed into one class.

(This and the other 3 programming courseworks came after the introduction to programming with 'Java exercises' https://github.com/bbk-pij-2012-20/JavaExercises)


<h3>Implementation details</h3>

The program should implement the interfaces provided below. Classes that implement an interface should have the same name with the “Impl” suffix unless there is more than one. For example, if there is only one class that implements ContactManager, it must be called ContactManagerImpl. Be careful with this, as it may interfere with automatic tools that will analyse your code.
