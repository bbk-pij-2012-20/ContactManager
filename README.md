Contact Manager 
---------------

This is the 1st of 4 programming courseworks I completed (Dec 2013 - Jan 2014) as part of a conversion masters in Computer Science at Birkbeck College London.

The coursework task was to implement interfaces describing a simple contact manager application. 

It was also intended that implementing the class ContactManager would serve as a demonstration of an anti-pattern ("the blob" aka "god object"), wherein too much functionality is placed into one class.

(This and the other 3 programming courseworks came after the introduction to programming with 'Java exercises' https://github.com/bbk-pij-2012-20/JavaExercises)
